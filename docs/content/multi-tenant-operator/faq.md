### Q. Error received while performing Create, Update or Delete action on namespace `"Cannot CREATE namespace test-john without label stakater.com/tenant"`

**A.** Error occurs when a user is trying to perform create, update, delete action on a namespace without the required label `stakater.com/tenant` which is used by the operator to see that authorized users can performing the action on namespace. Just add the label with the tenant name so that Multi Tenant Operator knows which tenant the namespace belongs to and who is authorized to perform create/update/delete operations. Fore more details please refer [Namespace use-case](./usecases/namespace.html).
