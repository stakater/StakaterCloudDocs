# Configuring Managed Namespaces and ServiceAccounts in IntegrationConfig

Bill is a cluster admin who can use `IntegrationConfig` to configure how `Tenant-Operator` manages the cluster.

By default, Tenant Operator watches all namespaces and will enforce all the governing policies on them. 
All namespaces managed by Tenant Operator require the `stakater.com/tenant` label. 
Tenant Operator ignores privileged namespaces that are mentioned in the IntegrationConfig, and does not manage them. These namespaces do not require the above-mentioned label. 

```bash
oc create namespace stakater-test
Error from server (Cannot Create namespace stakater-test without label stakater.com/tenant. User: Bill): admission webhook "vnamespace.kb.io" denied the request: Cannot CREATE namespace stakater-test without label stakater.com/tenant. User: Bill
```

Bill is trying to create a namespace without the `stakater.com/tenant` label. Creating a namespace without this label is only allowed if the namespace is privileged. Privileged namespaces will be ignored by TO and do not require the said label. Therefore, Bill will add the required regex in the IntegrationConfig, along with any other namespaces which are privileged and should be ignored by Tenant Operator - like `default`, or namespaces with prefixes like `openshift`, `kube`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationConfig
metadata:
  name: tenant-operator-config
  namespace: stakater-tenant-operator
spec:
  openshift:
    privilegedNamespaces:
      - ^default$
      - ^openshift*
      - ^kube*
      - ^stakater*
```

After mentioning the required regex (^stakater*) under `privilegedNamespaces`, Bill can create the namespace without interference.

```bash
oc create namespace stakater-test
namespace/stakater-test created
```

Tenant Operator will also disallow all users which are not tenant owners to perform CRUD operations on namespaces. This will also prevent Service Accounts from performing CRUD operations.

If Bill wants Tenant Operator to ignore Service Accounts, than Bill would simply have to add them in IntegrationConfig:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationConfig
metadata:
  name: tenant-operator-config
  namespace: stakater-tenant-operator
spec:
  openshift:
    privilegedServiceAccounts:
      - system:serviceaccount:openshift
      - system:serviceaccount:stakater
      - system:serviceaccount:kube
      - system:serviceaccount:redhat
      - system:serviceaccount:hive
```

Bill can also use regex patterns to ignore a set of service accounts:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationConfig
metadata:
  name: tenant-operator-config
  namespace: stakater-tenant-operator
spec:
  openshift:
    privilegedServiceAccounts:
      - ^system:serviceaccount:openshift*
      - ^system:serviceaccount:stakater*
```

## Configuring Vault in IntegrationConfig

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is used to secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

If Bill (the cluster admin) has Vault configured in his cluster, then he can take benefit from Tenant Operator's integration with Vault.

Tenant Operator automatically creates Vault secret paths for tenants, where tenant members can securely save their secrets. It also authorizes tenant members to access these secrets via OIDC.

Bill would first have to integrate Vault with Tenant Operator by adding the details in IntegrationConfig. For more [details](../integration-config.html#vault)

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1alpha1
kind: IntegrationConfig
metadata:
  name: tenant-operator-config
  namespace: stakater-tenant-operator
spec:
  vault:
    enabled: true
    endpoint:
      secretReference:
        name: vault-root-token
        namespace: vault
      url: >-
        https://vault.apps.prod.abcdefghi.kubeapp.cloud/
    sso:
      accessorID: auth_oidc_aa6aa9aa
      clientName: vault
```

Bill then creates a tenant for Anna and John:

```yaml
apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta2
kind: Tenant
metadata:
  name: bluesky
spec:
  owners:
    users:
    - anna@acme.org
  viewers:
    users:
    - john@acme.org
  quota: small
  sandbox: false
```

Now Bill goes to `Vault` and sees that a path for `tenant` has been made under the name `bluesky/kv`, confirming that Tenant members with the Owner or Edit roles now have access to the tenant's Vault path.

Now if Anna sign's in to the Vault via OIDC, she can see her tenants path and secrets. Whereas if John sign's in to the Vault via OIDC, he can't see his tenants path or secrets as he doesn't have the access required to view them.

## Configuring RHSSO (Red Hat Single Sign-On) in IntegrationConfig

Red Hat Single Sign-On [RHSSO](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on) is based on the Keycloak project and enables you to secure your web applications by providing Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities based on popular standards such as SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.

If Bill the cluster admin has RHSSO configured in his cluster, then he can take benefit from Tenant Operator's integration with RHSSO and Vault.

Tenant Operator automatically allows tenant members to access Vault via OIDC(RHSSO authentication and authorization) to access secret paths for tenants where tenant members can securely save their secrets.

Bill would first have to integrate RHSSO with Tenant Operator by adding the details in IntegrationConfig. [Visit here](../integration-config.html#rhsso-red-hat-single-sign-on) for more details.

```yaml
rhsso:
  enabled: true
  endpoint:
    secretReference:
      name: auth-secrets
      namespace: openshift-auth
    url: https://iam-keycloak-auth.apps.prod.abcdefghi.kubeapp.cloud/
```
