# How to host custom domains?

Consider have a domain `custom.domain.com`; and you want to host your application on your own domain instead of the default route provided by SAAP i.e. `<MYAPP_NAME>-<MYAPP_NAMESPACE>.apps.<CLUSTER_NAME>.<CLUSTER_ID>.kubeapp.cloud`. You can follow these steps in order to use your own domain:

1. Configure DNS
2. Configure TLS Certificates
3. Create Ingress for your Application
4. Verify

## 1. Configure DNS

In order to host your application on `custom.domain.com`. You need to point your DNS address on the public IP of the cluster's default router

### Option # 1: Create Manual entries

#### Step # 1: Obtain Public IP Address

Use the following command to get the Public IP address of your cluster:
```
nslookup "*.apps.$(oc get dns -ojsonpath='{.items[0].spec.baseDomain}')" | grep Address | tail -1
```

#### Step # 2: Create entry in your DNS Provider

Add `A` entry in your DNS provider to point `custom.domain.com` to the public IP obtained in the previous step.

### Option # 2: ExternalDNS

_TODO_


## 2. Configure TLS certificate secret

There are two ways to configure TLS Certificate secret:

1. Certmanager Operator
2. Bring Your Own Certificates (BYOC)

### Option # 1: Certmanager Operator

Certmanager Operator let's you automate the certification issuing process via Let's Encrypt CA. 

See [Cert-manager documentation](../certificates/cert-manager.md#Example-Certificate-Generation-using-Let's-Encrypt) for a working example

These Certificates are generated and can be rotated automatically via Certmanager Operator whenever an Ingress is created with annotation: `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: <ISSUER_NAME>`

::: tip
Consider using the cluster's default domain i.e. `*.kubeapp.cloud` for CI/staging envionment which are all secured by SAAP by default

If you you are doing GitOps with ArgoCD then you need to create an ArgoCD app like following that will watch cert-manager CRs and deploy them to the cluster:

```
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  # It's mandatory you don't name it cert-manager; as it will prune other managed resources
  name: certificate-manager
  namespace: openshift-stakater-argocd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: openshift-stakater-argocd
    server: "https://kubernetes.default.svc"
  source:
    path: <PATH>
    repoURL: <REPO-URL>
    targetRevision: HEAD
    directory:
       recurse: true
  project: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

### Option # 2: Bring Your Own Certificates (BYOC)

Generate TLS certificates of your domain i.e. `custom.domain.com` from your preferred CA and create a secret of the following format (secret can be secured via [SealedSecrets](../secrets/sealed-secrets.md#Secrets-Management-using-Sealed-Secrets-Controller)).

Replace concealed values with the corresponding base64 encoded certificate values.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca.crt: "<concealed>"
  tls.crt: "<concealed>"
  tls.key: "<concealed>"
kind: Secret
metadata:
# Add a unique name that includes your domain
  name: custom-domain-tls-cert
  namespace: <APP_NAMESPACE>
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```
This TLS certificate then can be referred in tls section of the Ingress resource.


## 3. Create Ingress for your Application

In you application values add Ingress section as followings:

```yaml
...
ingress:
  enabled: true
  servicePort: <SERVICE_PORT>
  hosts:
  - cusotm.domain.com
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: ca-issuer
  tls:
  - hosts:
      - custom.domain.com
    secretName: custom-domain-tls-cert
...
```
It will take 2-3 mins for certmanager to issue a certificate and upon success, `custom-domain-tls-cert` secret will be populated with the cert values.

## 4. Verify

A Route would be created in you application namespace. Open your route URL i.e `https://custom.domain.com` to view and verify your TLS secured web application
