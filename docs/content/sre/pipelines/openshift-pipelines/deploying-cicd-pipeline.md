# Deploying CI/CD Pipeline

## Workflow

![ci-workflow](./images/ci-workflow.jpg)

### Pre-requisites

Set-up everything from `Deploying Delivery Pipeline` but don't run the last step i.e create pipeline run. We will be using
triggers for automation now.

#### Create WebHook Secrets

Provide `GithubToken` created in section `1.1` as a base64 encoded string:

```bash
vi webhooks/secrets/webhook-secret.yaml
```

Create secret:

```bash
kubectl apply -f webhooks/secrets/webhook-secret.yaml -n <NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

#### Create Webhooks

Update Namespace value for unique webhooks:

```bash
# replace the <NAMESPACE_NAME> with your namespace
sed -i "s/NAMESPACE_NAME/<NAMESPACE_NAME>/g" webhooks/taskrun-webhook.yaml
```

Update Username value for creating a webhook in your forked repo:

```bash
# replace the <USERNAME> with your namespace
sed -i "s/USERNAME/<USERNAME>/g" webhooks/taskrun-webhook.yaml
```

Create Webhooks so that the pipelines get triggered on new PRs:

```bash
kubectl apply -f webhooks/. -n <NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

#### Create Triggers

Update Namespace and Username value according to your own namespace:

```bash
# replace the <NAMESPACE_NAME> field with your namespace
sed -i "s/NAMESPACE_NAME/<NAMESPACE_NAME>/g" triggers/trigger.yaml
# replace the <USERNAME> field with your username
sed -i "s/USERNAME/<USERNAME>/g" triggers/trigger.yaml
```

Create trigger resources:

```bash
kubectl apply -f triggers/trigger.yaml -n <NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

#### Test Route

Verify EventListener Route created in your namespace

On OpenShift Dashboard, On the left panel, Go to `Networking` -> `Routes` and verify an event listener route is created.

Verify by Opening the URL under `Location` and verify the response is similar to this:

```yaml
{"eventListener":"inventory-eventlistener","namespace":"<NAMESPACE>","eventID":"cx8n4"}
```

#### CI - Create A PR in the Forked Repository

Now attempt to make a PR in your forked repository. which will trigger an automated build.

Create a PR and verify its status

* Create a PR for the forked repo by adding a `test_file.txt` with some random text in a branch `test-branch`

* As soon as the PR is created Pipeline will be triggered which can be seen in OpenShift dashboard under `Pipeline` -> `Pipeline Runs`

* On successful build, the status would be shown as follows

![Pipeline Status](./images/success-PR.png)

* A comment will be posted on the PR on GitHub to reflect the status of the Pipeline

#### CD - Merge this PR into the master

Now attempt to merge this PR in master

Merge PR in master

* Merge the Pull Request in the master to rigger the pipeline on master branch

![Master status](./images/pr-merged.png)

* After successful execution a new release and tag will be created in the `Releases` section on GitHub

![new release](./images/new-tag.png)

#### Verify new Image

Verify that the new image is available in your registry

#### Verify new Tags

Verify forked repository to new newly pushed tag
